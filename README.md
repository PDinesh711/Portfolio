<h1> My Own Portfolio </h1>
Creating your own portfolio website is a great way to showcase your skills and projects to potential employers or clients. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a portfolio website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma, Photoshop, Git, and GitHub:


 <h1> Gather and Prepare Content:  </h1>
   Collect all the content you want to include on your portfolio website. This may include your resume, project descriptions, images, and any other relevant information. Use Photoshop to edit and optimize images if necessary.

<h1> Set Up Your Development Environment: </h1>
   Install a code editor like Visual Studio Code, and set up a local development environment. You'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed for JavaScript development.

<h1> Create HTML Structure: </h1>
   Start by creating the basic HTML structure for your website. Define the layout, header, navigation menu, and sections for your projects, about me, contact information, etc.

<h1> Style with CSS </h1>
   Apply CSS styles to make your website visually appealing. Use CSS for layout, typography, colors, and responsive design to ensure your site looks good on different devices.

<h1> Add Interactivity with JavaScript </h1>
   Enhance user experience by adding interactivity using JavaScript. You can create animations, navigation effects, and interactive project displays.

<h1> Build a Portfolio Section: </h1>
   Create a section to display your projects. Use HTML and CSS to structure and style each project entry. Include project titles, descriptions, images, and links.

**9. Create an About Me Page:**
   Dedicate a page to introduce yourself. Share your background, skills, and experience. You can include a professional photo of yourself.

**10. Implement a Contact Page:**
    Add a contact page with a contact form or provide contact information. Consider using a contact form service like Formspree to handle form submissions.
